Data was scraped from Spotify using a Python script it was then stored in MondoDB, for deployment purposes it was transferred to MongoDB Atlas. A Flask app calls the database and then the data is shown in a variety of ways including bar chats, swarm clouds, a bubble chart and a word cloud. These were created with HTML, JavaScript, and D3.
